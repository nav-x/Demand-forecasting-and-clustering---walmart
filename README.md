The focus was on using machine learning and clustering techniques to optimize inventory, pricing, and marketing strategies.

#Approach:
• Machine Learning: Models like XGBoost and Random Forest were used for sales forecasting.

• External Factors: Economic indicators such as Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) and Freight Rates were included to improve accuracy.

#Tools & Methodology:
• Datasets: Historical weekly sales data over 104 weeks, plus external economic
data.
• Models: XGBoost and Random Forest were top performers.
• Clustering: Used to segment stores/products for actionable insights.

#Outcomes:
• Improved Forecasting: XGBoost and Random Forest enhanced prediction
accuracy.
• Actionable Insights: Identified high-performing stores and price-sensitive
products for better pricing and inventory management.
• Strategic Optimization: Recommendations for dynamic pricing and targeted
marketing based on store and product clusters.
This approach o;ered Walmart valuable insights to improve operational e;iciency and profitability.
